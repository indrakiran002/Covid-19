   <center> <h1> <u>SRM AP joins COVID-19 fight with a donation of 25 lakhs </u></h1></center>
  
       <div class="d4">
   <p>The novel coronavirus has evolved as a pandemic which forced lockdown in many countries including India. The sudden surge in symptomatic cases requires funding for medicines, diagnostic kits, research to develop vaccines, development of medical infrastructure, as well as assisting daily wagers. The entire nation has risen to assist our Indian government to raise funds for the noble cause. In the premise of supporting the government to combat the outbreak, SRM University AP, Andhra Pradesh has offered its support to the government in every way possible.</p>

    <img  src="donation of the 25 lakhs.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="205" >
<p>The contribution of 25 lakhs was handed over to the Hon’ble Education Minister Dr. Adimulam Suresh by Pro Vice-Chancellor Prof. D. Narayana Rao, Director of Campus Life and Maintenance Venkataachalam and Media PRO, Venugopal.</p>
<p> In this distressing scenario, all the citizens of India are requested to combat against this pandemic by staying at home and taking adequate preventive measures. Dr. P Sathyanaranan, President of SRM university- AP said, “The COVID-19 Pandemic has created an unprecedented global catastrophe and a national public health emergency.</p>
<p> In this crisis, the measures taken by the Government of Andhra Pradesh under the leadership of the Hon’ble Chief Minister to combat the COVID-19, leaving no stones unturned, is commendable.”</p>
   <p>Earlier this week on Monday, responding to this calamity, SRM Group donated 1.15 crore on behalf of the employees of the institutes under the umbrella of the group. Dr. TR Paarivendhar, Chancellor, and Member of Parliament transferred the fund to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister’s Public Relief Fund.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, in lieu of the situation, SRM AP has sensitized the students, faculty, and staff by conducting a session on 6th March 2020 to create public awareness. Organized by the Department of Biology, the lecture session was coordinated by Prof. Jayaseelan Murugaiyan, Head of the Biology/Biotechnology Department The details of the session can be found here:<a href= "https://srmap.edu.in/awareness-campaign-covid-19-coronavirus/." target="blank">CLICK HERE</a><br>

<div class="d1">
<p>

    SRM AP gears up to fight against the advent of Corona Virus, or COVID-19 in India. This public awareness lecture held on 06.03.2020 (Friday) was organized by the department of Biology. The lecture session was coordinated by Prof. Jayaseelan Murugaiyan, Head of the Biology/Biotechnology Department.</p>
    <p> The lecture was split into 3 sessions- "Biology of Coronavirus" by Prof. C. Durga Rao, Dean-SLABS, "Coronavirus diagnosis" by Prof. Jayaseelan Murugaiyan, Head of the Biology/Biotechnology Department, and "Precautionary measures and handling the infection" by Dr. Lakshmi Rajyam, Medical Officer.
    </p>
<p>Prof. C. Durga Rao explains that a virus becomes active only when it enters a living body. He informs, “Generally, viruses are specific to host bodies (species of animals). However, at times they mutate and are able to transmit to human bodies, known as zoonotic transmission. Coronavirus is one such virus that was initiated from bats in China. The immune system of humans not being exposed to this form of mutated Corona Virus before fails to combat against it.</p>
<p>Dr. Rao adds that Coronavirus disrupts the respiratory function as our lungs weaken while our immune system fights against COVID 19. “The host body tries to neutralize the virus, which fights back and tries to inhibit host protein synthesis and hijack the system for its own protein synthesis, crippling the cells who were attacking the virus.”</p> 
<p>People with respiratory disorders, diabetes, and cancer are at higher risk of developing severe disease and death. The virus affects males more in comparison to women. Children below 10 years of age and pregnant women are less susceptible to the virus whereas males above 30 years are most likely to acquire the disease.</p>
<p>Dr. Rao persuades to keep calm saying that, “Although the virus spreads like wildfire, the mortality rate on the average is only 2.3%, together as a conscious community we can combat the situation. “</p>

<p>Prof. Jayaseelan explained the historical time line of Coronavirus starting from 1960’s to present day variant COVID 19. The challenges lie in identification and differentiation of common Human Coronavirus and COVID 19. He adds, “Being a new type of virus, identifying the parameters to detect the virus is difficult. Having a relevant diagnostic tool and validating it in a short duration remains a challenge.”</p>
<p> Unlike earlier outbreaks, this time viral genome is already made freely available at public repository National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). </p>
<p>Prof. Jayaseelan emphasized the need for reach of diagnostic kits to the clinics faster than the spread of virus itself. He emphasized the race between various diagnostic companies and explained that the test kits were approved by the government agencies in a record time. Prof. </p>
<p>Jayaseelan highlighted the different countries such as China, Germany, Thailand, US and France have already released their protocol for detection of viral gene markers from the human samples. The World Health Organization (WHO) already released the guidelines on laboratory testing of Coronavirus. </p>
<p>. Prof. Jayaseelan also explained about five sampling methods and precautions needs to be taken care during sampling, logistics and while working at diagnostic laboratories. The professor also informs us that the diagnostic process includes a test using three specimens - lower respiratory, upper respiratory and serum specimen. The immediate tests include a blanket test for all variants of coronavirus, including common flu, and gene sequencing test that locates the marker for the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>As of now, 15 government laboratories are operating in India to test for Coronavirus. These laboratories are under the umbrella of National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi, and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Alappuzha, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Mumbai. All the laboratories are coordinated by the National Institute of Virology, Pune.</p>

<p>Dr. Lakshmi Rajyam says that the first symptom of Corina Virus is a fever. She explained that the symptoms of COVID-19 - fever, cough, sneeze, breathing trouble, are similar to that of common cold. “As early as we can detect the cases, the more we can reduce the mortality rate”, says the physician. </p>
<p>She discusses, “The concern is because there is no treatment of any virus other than vaccination, and coronavirus is no exception.</p>
<p> A human body has no immunity against this virus as it is unaware of its traits. This virus is extremely contagious and spreads through human touch, air, and mucus droplets.”</p>

<p>Dr. Lakshmi urges, “Once symptoms appear, immediately take the test. If the results are positive, the test needs to be repeated every 2-3 weeks till the report shows negative results.”
    Precautions against this disease have been constructed in an analogy, interestingly the name of the place from where it was originated:</p>


    <p> WUHAN –</p>

    <p>W - Washing hands often,</p>
    
    <p>U - Use masks properly,</p>
    
    <p>H - Have temperature checked regularly,</p>
    
    <p>A - Avoid large crowds,</p>
    
    <p>N – Never touch face without washing hands</p>

    <center> <h2> <u>SRM STUDENT DEVELOPS REAL-TIME CORONA INFO TRACKER </u></h1></center>  
    <div class="d6">
    <img src="srm-student-develops-real-time-corona-info-tracker.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="205"
<p><p>Just when Coronavirus has taken the world by fear, a student of SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur has come up with an app that provides live information on the virus.
    The app named, CoronApp, was developed by Anupam Tiwari, a student of SRMIST, who is now an exchange student doing his startup semester in mechatronics (electrical engineering and computer science - EECS) at UC Berkley. He along with his teammates came up with this idea.
    Speaking about the app, Anupam said, “With the Coronavirus fear at a peak, I thought having a proper app containing all information about the same will be helpful.”</p>
    <p>
    He created a prototype overnight and pitched it to his friends, who loved the idea and decided to work on it with him.
    CoronApp for mobile browsers, now available, allows users to click on red dots on a map to get updates on virus cases.
    It integrates COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University, the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization (WHO), and a Twitter feed provides the latest curated news.</p>
    <p>
    “The process was tiresome,” he said and added, “When we were developing this application, to begin with, there were no other similar applications. There were only websites that provided chunks and chunks of information. We spent sleepless nights and massive brainpower on this. We gave ourselves one week because time was sensitive. In the end, everything was worth it.”
    Talking about the app, he further explained, “We wanted to create a platform that had all the information one should know about the Coronavirus; from statistics to basic precautions, and one can also input information manually. The app is updated in real-time as it is powered by data provided by the CDC and WHO.”</p>
    <p>
    Asked about how their app is different from the ones that already exist, he responded, “All apps seem to focus only on world data but our application provides people with localized user experience. Using the phone's location, the Geo-map automatically zooms into the user's location on the map, allowing them to see the reports of cases around them.</p>
     <p>This is the most important information people are looking for, and now, they can find it within seconds.”
    His team consists of Anushka Purohit, Year 2 from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST); Sahil Mehta, Year 1, EECS UCB; Ean Hall, Mechanical Engineering, UCB; Akonkwa Mubagwa, Haas School of Business, MBA, UCB; Manuel Smith, Haas MBA, UCB; Daniel Smith, Software developer and Sevith Rao, Haas MBA, and Doctor.
